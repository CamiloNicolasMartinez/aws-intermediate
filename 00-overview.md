# Process

* Lectures
* Demos and lab demos
* Hands-on labs with lab documents

# Slides, Lab Docs and Code

* Code  (`code` folder) has all scripts - use them for accuracy

PS: You'll download all this courseware soon in Lab 0 / Pre-requisites

^because reading from slides is boring so pay attention and take notes!
